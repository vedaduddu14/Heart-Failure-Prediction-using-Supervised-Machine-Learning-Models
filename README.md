# Heart-Failure-Prediction-using-Supervised-Machine-Learning-Models
This work was done during Introduction to Machine Learning where we have tried to replicate researcher David Chicco's work: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32013925/
Our paper uses other methods and some of the files are not uploaded as they are the same code with one line swapped. Our paper explains our methodology and results.
